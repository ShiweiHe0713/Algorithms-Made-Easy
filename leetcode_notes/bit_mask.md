| Operator    | Symbol | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AND         | `&`    | Sets bits that are set in both operands.                     |
| OR          | `      | Inclusive Or, sets a bit to 1 if either input value is 1     |
| XOR         | `^`    | Sets bits that are different between the two operands.       |
| NOT         | `~`    | Inverts all the bits (1 becomes 0, and vice versa).          |
| Left Shift  | `<<`   | Shifts the bits to the left, filling the right with 0.       |
| Right Shift | `>>`   | Shifts the bits to the right, filling the left with 0 or sign bit for negative numbers. |
