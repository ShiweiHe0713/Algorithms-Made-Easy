# PQ & Heap

**In [253. Meeting Rooms II](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/)** and **[621. Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)**, we can see some similarity: We want to always choose the largest or smallest element, so there's an order maintain unchanged. In meeting rooms II we always want to find the earliest end time in the heap, in task scheduler we always want to find the task with the highest frequency in order to make decisions with the next steps. So the sorting property is always maintained, if we want to constantly and dynamically get the largest or smallest element, we could use heap.



## Problems

### K Elements (Max/Min Heaps)
[973. K Closest Points]
[347. Top k Largest Elements]
[692. Top K Frequent Words] 
[378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix]



### Merging and Sorting
[23. Merge K Sorted Lists]
[88. Merge Sorted Arrays] 



### Frequency and Counting Problems (Heap or Custom Data Structures)
[895. Maximum Frequency Stack ]
[767. Reorganize String]



### Data Stream or Sliding Window (Heaps or Balanced Structures)
[295. Find Median from Data Stream]
[1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit]



### Miscellaneous or Specialized Heap/Queue
[264. Ugly Number II]
[1086. High Five]
