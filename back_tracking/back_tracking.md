# Back tracking

In [257 binary tree paths](/back_tracking/257_binary_tree_paths.py), 
- why we we don't have to delete the string after the dfs calls in the body like what we did in [1219](/back_tracking/1219_path_with_maximum_gold.py)?
- and why we don't have to delete the string after the dfs(node.left)?
